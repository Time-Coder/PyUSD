    """
    UsdGeomVisibilityAPI introduces properties that can be used to author
    visibility opinions.
   
    \\note
    Currently, this schema only introduces the attributes that are used to
    control purpose visibility. Later, this schema will define _all_
    visibility-related properties and UsdGeomImageable will no longer define
    those properties.
   
    The purpose visibility attributes added by this schema,
    _guideVisibility_, _proxyVisibility_, and _renderVisibility_ can each be
    used to control visibility for geometry of the corresponding purpose
    values, with the overall _visibility_ attribute acting as an
    override. I.e., if _visibility_ evaluates to "invisible", purpose
    visibility is invisible; otherwise, purpose visibility is determined by
    the corresponding purpose visibility attribute.

    Note that the behavior of _guideVisibility_ is subtly different from the
    _proxyVisibility_ and _renderVisibility_ attributes, in that "guide"
    purpose visibility always evaluates to either "invisible" or "visible",
    whereas the other attributes may yield computed values of "inherited" if
    there is no authored opinion on the attribute or inherited from an
    ancestor. This is motivated by the fact that, in Pixar"s user workflows,
    we have never found a need to have all guides visible in a scene by
    default, whereas we do find that flexibility useful for "proxy" and
    "render" geometry.

    This schema can only be applied to UsdGeomImageable prims. The
    UseGeomImageable schema provides API for computing the purpose visibility
    values that result from the attributes introduced by this schema.
